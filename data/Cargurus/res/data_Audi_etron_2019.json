Handled very well for an exceedingly heavy car (5700+ lbs). Plenty of seating space and full leg room for front passenger. Graphics and screens require a learning curve. At 193 long and 76 wide, this car takes up a lot of garage space. Real life range comes in around 180 miles on a full charge which makes it suitable for commuting and short trips. It seems to be in the same competitive class as the Jaguar i-Pace and the imminent Ford Mach-e as far as pricing goes, perhaps a little more expensive. Its fit and finish is superior to the Tesla Model Y but there is no comparison when it comes to MYs superior range and access to Teslas charging infrastructure.\n\n                ", "aspect": ""}, {"name": "", "consumer_review": "\n                    \n\n            e-Tron proves that an EV does not need to compromise on build, comfort, safety or even luxury.
