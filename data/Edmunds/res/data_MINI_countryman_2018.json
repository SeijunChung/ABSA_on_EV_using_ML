Though the base three-cylinder Cooper engine is perfectly acceptable in the smaller Minis, it might be a bit outmatched if you're frequently using the heavier Countryman to haul around people and cargo. We'd go with the Cooper S. The significant increase in performance (Mini estimates a 2-second difference in the sprint from zero to 60 mph) makes it worth the upgrade in our eyes, and we expect fuel economy between the two engines to be very similar.", "overall-review": "What do you do when you love the exciting  driving dynamics of the playful Mini Hatchback but need more passenger and  cargo space than it provides? Luckily, the 2017 Mini Countryman embodies the  spirit of its diminutive siblings in a package that makes it easy to share that  experience with your friends and family. \nThe fully redesigned Mini Countryman is  longer and wider than its predecessor, with more headroom, legroom and cargo  room than before. The base four-cylinder engine in the previous model has been  replaced by the turbocharged three-cylinder found in other Minis, while the  optional turbo-four offers more horsepower and torque. Current-generation Mini  interior design is finally incorporated into the Countryman; the speedometer is  now in a normal position in front of the driver and the central display is now  a touchscreen. \nThe 2017 Mini Countryman retains the  features that made us like it in the first place. The 40/20/40-split second row  slides and reclines, allowing rear passengers to make full use of the compact  dimensions. Interior materials look and feel like they are worth the price  premium Minis command. The stylized cabin design is also undoubtedly more  interesting than those of the Countryman's reserved rivals. Whether you view it  as a family-friendly Mini or simply a unique alternative to competing small  crossovers, the 2017 Countryman is ready to take you on your next adventure.\nThe 2017 Mini Countryman is a sporty and  fun alternative to the standard set of small crossovers and wagons. The  Countryman earns the premium price tag it carries by offering a substantial  list of standard features, and a plethora of available options allows buyers to  customize the Countryman to their heart's content. The two trims,  Cooper and  Cooper S,  have similar feature content but are differentiated by the engines underhood.  Whichever you get, you'll be rewarded by a Mini that prioritizes passenger  space and driving thrills in equal measure. \nPowering  the base front-wheel-drive Cooper trim  is a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine (134 horsepower, 162  pound-feet of torque) matched to your choice of a six-speed manual or six-speed  automatic transmission. On the all-wheel-drive Countryman All4, the automatic  transmission has eight speeds.\nYou  get a lot of features with the Countryman, including 17-inch wheels, summer  performance tires, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a heated windshield wiper  system, roof rails, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, a rearview  camera, rear parking sensors, adjustable driving modes, height-adjustable front  seats, 40/20/40-split rear seats, faux leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic  climate control, ambient lighting, Bluetooth, a 6.5-inch display screen and a  six-speaker audio system. \nOur  pick is the Cooper S, though. It has  a peppy turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) mated  to a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic. It also gets 18-inch wheels,  LED headlights and foglights, and heated front sport seats. All-wheel drive is  optional.\nThough  both Cooper and Cooper S typically draw from the same pool of options packages,  the Sport package is unique to the  Cooper. It includes the 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglights, and sport  seats from the Cooper S, along with adaptive suspension dampers. The Cooper's Cold Weather package adds heated front  seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.\nEvery  other package can be outfitted to either model. For those looking for  additional luxury and storage features, there's the Convenience package (rear armrest, vehicle alarm, cargo divider,  and a choice between a cargo area flip-out seating cushion or spare tire) and Premium package (power-adjustable front  seats, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, tinted glass and a hands-free  power liftgate). The Technology package  includes a wealth of upgrades, including an 8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, a  head-up display, wireless phone charging and an automated parallel parking  system. The Fully Loaded package  includes all four above packages plus satellite radio and the Cold Weather  package.\nIf  appearance-oriented upgrades are more your thing, the John Cooper Works Interior package includes a unique steering  wheel, sport seats (if not already equipped), a black headliner and JCW-branded  decorations, while the JCW Exterior package adds 18-inch wheels, a rear spoiler, additional stability control  choices and aerodynamic modifications.\nMany  of the above options can be ordered separately. Additional stand-alone options  include 19-inch wheels, all-season tires, leather upholstery,  steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters (automatic-equipped Cooper S models  only), and exterior and interior styling modifications.", "overall-score": "4.0 / 5", "maker": "MINI", "model": "countryman", "production_year": "2017", "price": "", "trending_topic": {"pros": ["safety"], "cons": ["value", "maintenance & parts", "interior", "reliability & manufacturing quality", "transmission", "lights", "cup holders", "appearance", "doors", "sound system", "dashboard", "handling & steering", "steering wheel", "infotainment system", "road noise", "brakes", "warranty", "oil", "fuel efficiency", "driving experience"]}, "pros": ["Exterior and interior design sets it apart from competitors", "Materials are of a higher quality than those of subcompact rivals", "One of the only vehicles of its kind with a manual transmission", "Provides a sporty driving experience"], "cons": ["Front seats are confining and won't be comfortable for everyone", "Cargo area is small compared to almost every rival's", "Both engines require premium fuel"], "expert": {"Driving": [{"class": "Driving-overall", "score": 4.0, "expert_review": "The Countryman Cooper S is more entertaining to drive than most traditional compact crossovers, but it's not as quick as luxury alternatives such as the BMW X1 and Volvo V60.

a  similarly equipped four-door Hardtop or Clubman, but those are considerably  smaller), but many will find its three-cylinder engine underpowered when  weighed down with passengers or cargo. The price is quite a bit more, but we'd  pay the premium for the Cooper S.  The four-cylinder is up to the task of moving this rig, and its quicker  acceleration will remind you why you're buying a Mini in the first place. If  you have a little wiggle room in your budget, the Cold Weather and Premium  packages are worth adding.", "overall-review": "Even though its beefy dimensions easily  make it the largest vehicle in Mini's lineup, the 2018 Countryman keeps the  playful spirit of the brand intact. With a comparatively roomy cabin and  decently sized cargo area, this is the Mini to get if you plan on bringing  friends along for the ride. It's also a great choice if you want a fun and  highly customizable crossover with more personality than the others. Either  way, new additions for 2018 ensure the Mini Countryman offers something for  everyone.\nTwo new models \u2014 the sporty  John Cooper Works and fuel-efficient Countryman S E plug-in hybrid \u2014  join the roster this year. Like other JCW variants across Mini's lineup, this  high-octane thriller boosts the output of the turbocharged four-cylinder to 228  horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. And yes, you can get it with a manual  transmission. The S E plug-in hybrid is unique to the Countryman. It takes the  Cooper's turbocharged three-cylinder and pairs it to an electric motor, giving  it 12 miles of all-electric range. It also offers significant horsepower and  torque gains while achieving the same combined fuel economy as the standard  car.\nNotably, we picked the 2018 MINI Countryman as one of Edmunds' Best Small SUVs for 2018.\nEdmunds' editors acquired a 2018 Countryman during a long-term test. Over the course of the year, our Countryman, a plug-in S E Hybrid model, logged more than 14,000 miles of real-world driving. What were the biggest takeaways? Compared to most small crossovers, the Countryman offers a fun driving personality and a premium interior. But aspects such as its limited all-electric range and pricing more akin to that for a Lexus or Audi left us wanting. Read the long-term Countryman test to see our full impressions.\nThe 2018 Mini Countryman is a sporty and  fun alternative to the standard set of small crossovers and wagons. The  Countryman earns the premium price tag it carries by offering a substantial  list of standard features, while a plethora of available options allows buyers  to customize the Countryman to their heart's content. All four trims  \u2014 Cooper, Cooper S, John Cooper Works and Cooper  S E \u2014 have similar feature content but are differentiated by the  engines underhood. Whichever you get, you'll be rewarded with a Mini that prioritizes  passenger space and driving thrills in equal measure. \nPowering  the base front-wheel-drive Cooper is  a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine (134 horsepower, 162 pound-feet  of torque) matched to your choice of a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic  transmission. On the all-wheel-drive Countryman All4, the automatic  transmission has eight speeds.\nYou  get a lot of features with the Countryman, including 17-inch wheels, summer  performance run-flat tires, automatic wipers, heated mirrors, a heated  windshield wiper system, roof rails, a panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and  ignition, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, adjustable driving modes,  height-adjustable front seats, 40/20/40-split rear seats, simulated leather  upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, ambient lighting, Bluetooth, a  6.5-inch display screen and a six-speaker audio system. Selecting all-wheel  drive also adds heated front seats.\nOur  pick is the next-level Cooper S. It  has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (189 hp, 207 lb-ft) mated to  an eight-speed automatic transmission. It also gets 18-inch wheels, LED  headlights and foglights, front sport seats and additional stability control  choices. A six-speed manual is standard with all-wheel drive models, with the  eight-speed auto optional. \nAs  opposed to the Cooper and Cooper S, all-wheel drive is standard on the next two  models. The John Cooper Works trim  adds an even more powerful version of the turbocharged four-cylinder (228 hp,  258 lb-ft); the manual is standard and the eight-speed auto is optional.  Additional features include aerodynamic modifications, a rear spoiler, a  sport-tuned suspension and aggressively bolstered front seats. LED foglights  are not available.\nThe Cooper S E is quite different from  the rest of the lineup. Up front is the Cooper's turbocharged three-cylinder  engine that drives the front wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission.  In back, and driving the rear wheels, is an electric motor powered by a  rechargeable 7.6 kWh battery pack. Mini says total combined output for the S E  is 221 hp and 284 lb-ft. EPA estimated all-electric driving range is 12 miles.  The Cooper S E's feature content is identical to that of the Cooper S, though  it's the only model in the range to not have a panoramic sunroof standard.\nThough  all models typically draw from the same pool of options packages, the Sport package is unique to the Cooper.  It includes the 18-inch wheels, LED headlights and foglights, and sport seats  from the Cooper S, along with adaptive suspension dampers. The Cooper's Cold Weather package adds heated front  seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.\nOther  packages can be outfitted to all models. If you're looking for additional  luxury and storage features, there's the Convenience package (rear armrest, vehicle alarm, cargo divider, and a choice between a  cargo area flip-out seating cushion or spare tire) and Premium package (power-adjustable front seats, a 12-speaker Harman  Kardon audio system, tinted glass, a hands-free power liftgate, and, for the  Cooper S E, the panoramic sunroof). The Technology package includes a wealth of upgrades, including front parking sensors, an  8.8-inch touchscreen, navigation, a head-up display, wireless phone charging,  Apple CarPlay and an automated parallel parking system. The Fully Loaded package includes the above  packages plus satellite radio and the Cold Weather package.\nIf  appearance-oriented upgrades are more your thing, you can add many of the JCW's  features to the other trims with the John  Cooper Works Interior package (a unique steering wheel, sport seats (if not  already equipped), a black headliner and JCW-branded decorations) and the JCW Exterior package (18-inch wheels, a  rear spoiler, aerodynamic modifications, and, for the Cooper and Cooper S E,  additional stability control choices). \nMany  of the above options can be ordered separately.

Feels as if there's more body roll than in a Mazda CX-5."}, {"class": "Drivability", "score": "8.0", "expert_review": "The clutch is easy to operate, with a catch point just off the floor, so you barely have to ease up before forward movement ensues. The clutch pedal isn't heavy either. Shifter throws are a little long and rubbery, but it's easy to find the right gate. Cruise control reduces set speed when turning."}], "Comfort": [{"class": "Comfort-overall", "score": 6.5, "expert_review": "The Countryman exhibits a degree of comfort that is surprising given Mini's sporting reputation. The ride is rarely choppy, and the cabin is fairly quiet. The rear vents help keep rear passengers happy. The aggressively bolstered front seats and heat-trapping upholstery are major drawbacks."}, {"class": "Seat comfort", "score": "5.5", "expert_review": "The side bolsters on these seats are thick and keep you in place during hard cornering. But  the seatback and bottom are narrow, forcing you to rest your legs on the thigh bolsters. Many people will find them too confining. Non-sport seats are only available on the Cooper and hybrid."}, {"class": "Ride comfort", "score": "7.5", "expert_review": "The ride is surprisingly comfortable, even with large 18-inch wheels and run-flat tires. It feels a bit livelier than some competitors, but it's supple by Mini standards. Adaptive dampers are available if you want to choose your own adventure."}, {"class": "Noise & vibration", "score": "7.0", "expert_review": "There's not much wind noise, and even tire noise is reasonably quelled. The sunroof covers rattle if they're closed and you hit a bump, but move them slightly out of place and that'll disappear. The engine stop-start system sends a shudder through the cabin when it kicks on."}, {"class": "Climate control", "score": "6.5", "expert_review": "Auto climate control has to work hard to cool the cabin and counteract heat radiating from the panoramic sunroof on a hot day. Temperature adjustments are in 2-degree increments. Seats don't breathe well, but the cloth/faux leather coverings may still be better than non-cloth seats in warm climes."}], "Interior": [{"class": "Interior-overall", "score": 7.0, "expert_review": "The Countryman boasts a sense of roominess that you won't find in other Minis. There are thoughtful touches such as an instrument panel that moves with the steering wheel and folding rear headrests. There are some ergonomic issues, including an awkwardly located seatback tilt lever and lumbar knob."}, {"class": "Ease of use", "score": "6.5", "expert_review": "Most things up front are easy to reach, from the toggle switches to the infotainment system controller. The awkward lumbar knob, on the inboard side of the seatback, is an exception. The door-mounted armrests are at a perfect length, but there's no rear center armrest."}, {"class": "Getting in/getting out", "score": "7.0", "expert_review": "The Countryman has a step-in height that's slightly taller than that of high-riding hatchbacks such as the Mercedes GLA-Class and BMW X1, so you don't fall into the seat when you enter. That said, ingress and egress aren't quite effortless; large seat bolsters can make it hard to exit the front."}, {"class": "Driving position", "score": "7.5", "expert_review": "The front seats allow plenty of fore, aft and height travel, ensuring drivers of any size will be able to find a good position. Eventually, that is, since the headrests are angled too far forward and the clutch pedal travel is long, making it difficult to find a comfortable setup initially."}, {"class": "Roominess", "score": "7.0", "expert_review": "There's an abundance of headroom up front, even with the panoramic sunroof. Shoulder room is lacking due to the aforementioned seat bolsters. There's decent legroom and headroom in the back, and the front seatback is sculpted for extra kneeroom."}, {"class": "Visibility", "score": "9.0", "expert_review": "All windows are tall and wide, and there's even a large window in the rear three-quarters portion to minimize blind spots. A standard rearview camera is nice but unnecessary given the ample window openings. The bump on the hood makes it tough to figure out where the right side of the car is."}, {"class": "Quality", "score": "9.5", "expert_review": "Inspired interior design and high build quality elevate the Countryman above the usual selection of compact crossovers and even give the luxury brands a run for the money. Molded plastic on the upper door panels, a soft-touch surface on the dash, and cloth on the door make it feel premium."}], "Utility": [{"class": "Utility-overall", "score": 7.0, "expert_review": "While the cargo area is a bit small for the class, the floor sits well below the top of the back seat, so you can load tall items without encroaching on rear visibility. There are limited storage solutions for those in the back because there's no armrest or flip-out tray behind the center console."}, {"class": "Small-item storage", "score": "7.5", "expert_review": "There are large cutouts in all the doors, each split in two sections. Both sections will hold a bottle of water. There's a small tray in front of the shifter and a bin under the armrest for front occupants. There's no fold-down center armrest in the back, which would normally house a tray."}, {"class": "Cargo space", "score": "6.0", "expert_review": "The cargo area is wide and boxy, with a liftover height that's a couple inches lower than in a typical crossover. It measures 17.6 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 47.6 cubes with them folded; both figures are small for the class. A nifty LED light in the back helps you find stuff in the dark."}, {"class": "Child safety seat accommodation", "score": "8.5", "expert_review": "There are four LATCH anchors, two on each of the outboard seats. There are easily accessed, located under clearly marked flip-up covers. There's one tether on the back of each portion of the 40/20/40-split rear seats. You'll have to pop the cargo door or remove the cargo cover to access them."}], "Technology": [{"class": "Technology-overall", "score": 8.5, "expert_review": "The newest version of Mini's user interface is attractive but seems to be a bit more cumbersome to use than in previous iterations. The maps, however, are less cluttered than before. Voice controls work well, with natural voice commands. Many advanced safety features are available."}, {"class": "Audio & navigation", "score": "7.5", "expert_review": "The Countryman's central display screen gains touchscreen functionality this year. Because there's so much iconography (at least from the main screen), you're better off using the controller. The menus' horizontal buttons further make the case for the controller. Satellite radio frequently drops."}, {"class": "Smartphone integration", "score": "7.0", "expert_review": "There are two USB ports in the front: one in a bin in front of the shifter and one under the central armrest. There are no USB ports in the back. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay aren't offered, but some apps, such as Spotify and Pandora, are accessible through audio menus."}, {"class": "Driver aids", "score": "8.0", "expert_review": "A rearview camera and rear parking sensors are standard on all models. Our tester was also equipped with the Technology package, adding front sensors and a larger central screen. Park too closely to an object in front and the sensor issues a loud alert even if you're not in gear."}, {"class": "Voice control", "score": "9.5", "expert_review": "The voice controls are excellent. The system recognizes natural speech rather than forcing the user to travel down a path of predetermined phrases. The navigation function can redirect to a similar house number if it can't find yours in the system.

Has a firm ride if you're not used to it but still a blast to drive after 18 months and 14,000 miles and everyone loves the looks of it.  Think the run flat tires make the ride firmer than it needs to be.  Hugs corners and just makes you want to drive fast.  Very quick although I think the two door Cooper S models are a bit faster. It has an amazing amount of room inside for the kids in the back seat.  The high pressure fuel pump was replaced at 6,000 miles but the dealer in Highlands Ranch, CO was great to work with since under warranty.
